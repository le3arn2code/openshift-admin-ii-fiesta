# Simple Explanation

This lab introduced Kubernetes and OpenShift basics.
You connected to a cluster, listed nodes, namespaces, and pods, and learned how to run and debug workloads.

Even though CoreDNS crashed due to network restrictions, you fixed it several times, tested DNS lookups, and confirmed understanding of cluster internals.

You now know how to:
- Check cluster health
- Describe and log pods
- Edit and reapply YAML manifests
- Troubleshoot services and DNS
