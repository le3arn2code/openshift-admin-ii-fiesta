# Layman Explanation

Imagine OpenShift as a shared office.  
- **Resource quotas** limit how much space each team can use.  
- **RBAC roles** decide who can open which doors.  
- **Network policies** ensure teams can talk internally but not interfere with others.  
- **Pod security** enforces safety rules so nobody runs unsafe code.

This setup lets developers work freely but safely in their own space.
