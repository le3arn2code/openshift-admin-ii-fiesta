# Lab 15: Enable Developer Self-Service

## Objectives
In this lab, we configured developer self-service capabilities in OpenShift, including:
- Resource quotas and limit ranges for resource control
- RBAC role and rolebinding for developer access
- Pod Security and Network Policies for compliance and isolation

## Key Results
- Verified resource quotas: compute, storage, build limits
- Created `my-viewer-role` and bound it with `my-viewer-rolebinding`
- Verified sandbox network policies and Pod Security Standards
