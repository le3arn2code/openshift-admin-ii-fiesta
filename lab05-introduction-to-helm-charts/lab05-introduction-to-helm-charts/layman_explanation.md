# Layman Explanation
Think of **Helm** like an 'App Store' for Kubernetes.  
Instead of writing multiple YAML files manually, you use Helm charts — reusable blueprints — to install complex apps with one command.

In this lab:
- We built a mini Nginx webapp as a Helm chart.
- Configurations like replicas, CPU, memory, and environment variables were parameterized.
- We deployed, verified, and repackaged the app, learning Helm’s full workflow.
