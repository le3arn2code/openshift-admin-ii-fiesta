# Layman Explanation

In this lab, we learned how to package an application's deployment into a reusable OpenShift Template.
Instead of creating a Deployment, Service, and Route separately, we define them once with parameters.
When we "process" the template, OpenShift fills in the parameters and deploys everything automatically.

It’s like filling out a form once and deploying anywhere—development, staging, or production—just by changing values.
