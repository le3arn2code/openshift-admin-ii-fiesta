# Lab 14: Automating Application Deployment with Operators

## Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of Kubernetes Operators and their role in application lifecycle management.
- Install and configure the PostgreSQL Operator using open-source tools.
- Deploy a PostgreSQL database instance using the Operator pattern.
- Perform database lifecycle operations including scaling, backup, and failover scenarios.
- Troubleshoot common issues with Operator-managed applications.
- Evaluate the benefits of using Operators for production database management.

## Summary
We successfully deployed the PostgreSQL Operator (offline version) on Minikube, created a PostgresCluster resource, verified its registration and reconciliation, and simulated operator-based management.
